Simulate Baking in a Proof of Stake Network

Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop an application that connects to a test network. The application will simulate nodes in a Proof of Stake network, playing the role of Bakers responsible for validating transactions and adding blocks to the blockchain.

Network Configuration:

The necessary information to connect to the test network will be provided, including the network address, port, and any required authentication details. The code will be run locally to start the solution. The server will serve as a network interface with which the application can communicate.

Application Development:

The goal is to create an application that connects to the provided test network. The application should simulate the role of Bakers in the Proof of Stake network. Bakers are responsible for validating transactions and adding blocks to the blockchain. The following functionalities must be implemented:

Establish a connection to the test server.
Retrieve transactions from the network.
Validate transactions by performing necessary checks (e.g., verifying transaction amounts and methods).
Broadcast the new block to the network.
Handle all error conditions and display appropriate error messages.
